Principles of Miracles\n1.1 There is no order of difficulty\n  among miracles. One is not \"harder\" or \"bigger\"\n  than another. They are all the same. All expressions of love are\n  maximal.\n2. 2 Miracles as such do not matter.\n  The only thing that matters is their Source, Which is far beyond\n  human evaluation.\n\n  3. 3 Miracles occur naturally as\n  expressions of love. The real miracle is the love that inspires them.\n  In this sense, everything that comes from love is a miracle.\n\n  4 4 All miracles mean life, and God\n  is the Giver of life. His Voice will direct you very specifically.\n  You will be told all you need to know.\n\n  5. 5 Miracles are habits and should\n  be involuntary. They should not be under conscious control.\n  Consciously selected miracles can be misguided.\n\n  6. 6 Miracles are natural. When they\n  do not occur, something has gone wrong.\n\n  7. 7 Miracles are everyone's\n  right, but purification is necessary first.\n\n  8. 8 Miracles are healing because they supply a lack in that they are performed by those who\n  temporarily have more for those who temporarily have less.\n\n  9. 9 Miracles are a kind of exchange.\n  Like all expressions of love, which are always miraculous in\n  the true sense, the exchange reverses the physical laws. They bring\n  more love both to the giver and the receiver.\n\n  10. 10 The use of miracles as\n  spectacles to induce belief is wrong, or better, is a\n  misunderstanding of their purpose. They are really used for\n  and by believers.\n\n  11. 11 Prayer is the medium of\n  miracles. Prayer is the natural communication of the created with the\n  Creator. Through prayer love is received, and through miracles love\n  is expressed.\n\n  12. 12 Miracles are thoughts.\n  Thoughts can represent lower-order or higher-order reality. This is\n  the basic distinction between intellectualizing and thinking. One\n  makes the physical and the other creates the spiritual, and we\n  believe in what we make or create.\n\n  13. 13 Miracles are both beginnings\n  and endings. They thus alter the temporal order. They are always\n  affirmations of rebirth which seem to go back but really go forward.\n  They undo the past in the present and thus release the future.\n\n  14. 14 Miracles bear witness to\n  truth. They are convincing because they arise from conviction.\n  Without conviction they deteriorate into magic, which is mindless and\n  therefore destructive, or rather the uncreative use of mind.\n\n  15. 15 Each day should be devoted to\n  miracles. The purpose of time is to enable man to learn to use it\n  constructively. Time is thus a teaching device and a means to an end.\n  It will cease when it is no longer useful in facilitating\n  learning.\n\n  16. 16 Miracles are teaching devices\n  for demonstrating that it is more blessed to give than to receive.\n  They simultaneously increase the strength of the giver and supply\n  strength to the receiver.\n\n  17. 17 Miracles are the transcendence\n  of the body. They are sudden shifts into invisibility, away from a\n  sense of lower-order reality. That is why they heal.\n\n  18. 18 A miracle is a service. It is\n  the maximal service one individual can render another. It is a way of\n  loving your neighbor as yourself. The doer recognizes his own and his\n  neighbor's inestimable worth simultaneously.\n\n  19. 19 Miracles make minds one in\n  God. They depend on cooperation because the Sonship is the sum of all\n  the Souls God created. Miracles therefore rest on the laws of\n  eternity, not of time.\n\n  20. 20 Miracles reawaken the\n  awareness that the spirit, not the body, is the altar of truth. This\n  is the recognition that leads to the healing power of the\n  miracle.\n\n  21. 21 Miracles are natural\n  expressions of total forgiveness. Through miracles, man accepts\n  God's forgiveness by extending it to others.\n\n  22. 22 Miracles are associated with\n  fear only because of the fallacious belief that darkness can\n  hide. Man believes that what he cannot see does not exist, and\n  his physical eyes cannot see in the dark. This is a very primitive\n  solution and has led to a denial of the Spiritual eye. [1] The escape from darkness involves two\n  stages:\n\n  A. 23 The recognition that darkness\n  cannot hide. This step usually entails fear.\n\n  B. 24 The recognition that there is\n  nothing you want to hide, even if you could. This step\n  brings escape from fear.\n\n  23. 25 Miracles rearrange perception\n  and place the levels of perception in true perspective. This heals at\n  all levels because sickness comes from confusing the\n  levels.\n\n  26 When you have become\n  willing to hide nothing, you will not only be willing to enter into\n  communion but will also understand peace and joy. Your commitment is\n  not yet total, and that is why you still have more to learn than to\n  teach. When your equilibrium stabilizes, you will be able to teach as\n  much as you learn, which will give you the proper balance. Meanwhile,\n  remember that no effort is wasted, for unless you remember this, you\n  cannot avail yourselves of my efforts, which are\n  limitless. Only eternity is real. Why not use the illusion of time\n  constructively?\n\n  24. 27 Miracles enable man to heal\n  the sick and raise the dead because he made sickness and death\n  himself and can abolish both. You are a miracle, capable of\n  creating in the likeness of your Creator. Everything else is only\n  your own nightmare and does not exist. Only the creations of light\n  are real.\n\n  25. 28 Miracles are part of an\n  interlocking chain of forgiveness which, when completed, is the\n  Atonement. This process works all the time and in all the dimensions\n  of time.\n\n  29 I am in charge of the\n  process of Atonement, which I undertook to begin. When you offer a\n  miracle unto any of my brothers, you do it unto yourself and\n  me. The reason you come before me is that I do not need\n  miracles for my own Atonement, but I stand at the end in case you\n  fail temporarily. The purpose of my part in the Atonement is the\n  canceling out of all lacks of love which men could not otherwise\n  correct. The word \"sin\" should be changed to \"lack of\n  love\" because \"sin\" is a man-made word with threat\n  connotations which he made up himself. No real threat is\n  involved anywhere. Nothing is gained by frightening yourselves, and\n  it is very destructive to do so.\n\n  26. 30 Miracles represent\n  freedom from fear. \"Atoning\" really means\n  \"undoing.\" The undoing of fear is an essential part of the\n  Atonement value of miracles.\n\n  31 The purpose of the\n  Atonement is to restore everything to you, or rather to restore it to\n  your awareness. You were given everything when you were created, just\n  as everyone was. When you have been restored to the recognition of\n  your original state, you naturally become part of the Atonement\n  yourself. As you share my inability to tolerate lack of love in\n  yourself and others, you must join the Great Crusade to correct it.\n  The slogan for the Crusade is \"Listen, learn and\n  do\": Listen to my voice, learn to undo error, and\n    do something to correct it. The first two are not enough. \n    The real members of my party are active\nworkers.\n\n  32 The power to work miracles\n  belongs to you. I will provide the opportunities to do them,\n  but you must be ready and willing since you are already able.\n  Doing them will bring conviction in the ability since conviction\n  really comes through accomplishment. The ability is the potential;\n  the achievement is its expression; and the Atonement is the\n  purpose.\n\n  27. 33 A miracle is a universal\n  blessing from God through me to all my brothers. It is the\n  privilege of the forgiven to forgive.\n\n  34 The disciples were\n  specifically told to be physicians of the Lord and to heal others.\n  They were also told to heal themselves and were promised that\n  I would never leave them or forsake them. Atonement is the natural\n  profession of the Children of God because they have professed me.\n  \"Heaven and earth shall pass away\" simply means that they\n  will not continue to exist as separate states. My word, which is the\n  resurrection and the light, shall not pass away because light is\n  eternal. You are the work of God, and His work is wholly\n  lovable and wholly loving. This is how a man must think of\n  himself in his heart because this is what he is.\n\n  28. 35 Miracles are a means of\n  organizing different levels of consciousness.\n\n  36 Miracles come from the\n  below or subconscious level. Revelations come from the above or\n  superconscious level. The conscious level is in between and reacts to\n  either sub- or superconscious impulses in varying ratios.\n  Consciousness is the level which engages in the world and is capable\n  of responding to both. Having no impulses from itself and being\n  primarily a mechanism for inducing response, it can be very\n  wrong.\n\n  37 Revelation induces\n  complete but temporary suspension of doubt and fear. It represents\n  the original form of communication between God and His Souls,\n  involving an extremely personal sense of closeness to creation which\n  man tries to find in physical relationships. Physical closeness\n  cannot achieve this. The subconscious impulses properly induce\n  miracles, which are genuinely interpersonal and result in real\n  closeness to others. This can be misunderstood by a personally\n  willful consciousness as impulses toward physical gratification.\n\n  38 Revelation unites Souls\n  directly with God. Miracles unite minds directly with each other.\n  Neither emanates from consciousness, but both are experienced\n  there. This is essential since consciousness is the state which\n  induces action, though it does not inspire it. Man is free to\n  believe what he chooses, and what he does attests to what he\n  believes. The deeper levels of the subconscious always contain\n  the impulse to miracles, but man is free to fill its more superficial\n  levels, which are closer to consciousness, with the impulses of this\n  world and to identify himself with them. This results in\n  denying himself access to the miracle level underneath. In his\n  actions, then, his relationships also become superficial, and\n  miracle-inspired relating becomes impossible.\n\n  29. 39 Miracles are a way of\n  earning release from fear.\n\n  40 Revelation induces a state\n  in which fear has already been abolished. Miracles are thus a\n  means, and revelation is an end. [In this sense, they work together.]\n  Miracles do not depend on revelation; they induce it.\n  Revelation is intensely personal and cannot actually be translated\n  into conscious content at all. That is why any attempt to describe it\n  in words is usually incomprehensible. Revelation induces only\n  experience. Miracles, on the other hand, induce [interpersonal]\n  action. Miracles are more useful now because of their\n  impersonal nature. In this phase of learning, working miracles\n  is more important because freedom from fear cannot be thrust upon\n  you.\n\n  30. 41 Miracles praise God through\n  men. They praise God by honoring His creations, affirming their\n  perfection. They heal because they deny body-identification and\n  affirm Soul-identification. By perceiving the spirit, they adjust the\n  levels and see them in proper alignment. This places the spirit at\n  the center, where Souls can communicate directly.\n\n  31. 42 Miracles should inspire\n  gratitude, not awe. Man should thank God for what he really is. The\n  Children of God are very holy, and the miracle honors their\n  holiness.\n\n  43 God's creations never\n  lose their holiness, although it can be hidden. The miracle uncovers\n  it and brings it into the light where it belongs. Holiness can never\n  be really hidden in darkness, but man can deceive himself about it.\n  This illusion makes him fearful because he knows in his heart it is\n  an illusion, and he exerts enormous efforts to establish its reality.\n  The miracle sets reality where it belongs. Eternal reality belongs\n  only to the Soul, and the miracle acknowledges only the truth. It\n  thus dispels man's illusions about himself and puts him in\n  communion with himself and God.\n\n  32. 44 Christ inspires all miracles,\n  which are really intercessions. They intercede for man's holiness\n  and make his perceptions holy. By placing him beyond the physical\n  laws, they raise him into the sphere of celestial order. In\n  this order, man is perfect.\n\n  45 The Soul never loses its\n  communion with God. Only the mind needs Atonement. The miracle\n  joins in the Atonement of Christ by placing the mind in the service\n  of the spirit. This establishes the proper function of the mind and\n  corrects its errors.\n\n  33. 46 Miracles honor man\n  because he is lovable. They dispel illusions about him and\n  perceive the light in him. They thus atone for his errors by freeing\n  him from his own nightmares. They release him from a prison in which\n  he has imprisoned himself, and by freeing his mind from\n  illusions, they restore his sanity. Man's mind can be\n  possessed by illusions, but his spirit is eternally free. If a mind\n  perceives without love, it perceives an empty shell and is unaware of\n  the spirit within it. But the Atonement restores the Soul to its\n  proper place. The mind that serves the spirit is invulnerable.\n\n  34. 47 Miracles restore the mind to\n  its fullness. By atoning for lack, they establish perfect protection.\n  The strength of the Soul leaves no room for intrusions. The forgiven\n  are filled with the Soul, and they forgive in return. It is the duty\n  of the released to release their brothers.\n\n  48 The forgiven are\n  the means of Atonement. Those released by Christ must join in\n  releasing their brothers, for this is the plan of the Atonement.\n  Miracles are the way in which minds which serve the spirit unite with\n  Christ for the salvation or release of all God's creations.\n\n  35. 49 Miracles are expressions of\n  love, but it does not follow that they will [be effective]. I am the only one who can perform miracles indiscriminately because I am the Atonement. You have a\n  role in the Atonement, which I will dictate to you. Ask\n  me which miracles you should perform. This spares you\n  exhaustion because you will act under direct communication.\n\n  36. 50 Christ-controlled miracles are\n  part of the Atonement, but Christ-guidance is personal and leads to\n  personal salvation. The impersonal nature of miracles is an\n  essential ingredient because this enables me to control their\n  distribution. Christ-guidance leads to the highly personal\n  experience of revelation. This is why it involves personal\n  choice. A guide does not control, but he does direct,\n  leaving the following up to you. \"Lead us not into\n  temptation\" means \"guide us out of our own errors.\"\n  \"Take up thy cross and follow me\" means, \"Recognize\n  your errors and choose to abandon them by following my\n  guidance.\"\n\n  51 Remember that error cannot\n  really threaten truth, which can always withstand it.\n  Only the error is really vulnerable. You are free to establish\n  your kingdom where you see fit, but the right choice is inevitable if\n  you remember this:\n\n  52 The Soul is in a state of grace forever. Man's reality is only his Soul. Therefore, man is in a state of grace forever.\n\n  53 Atonement undoes all\n  errors in this respect and thus uproots the real source of\n  fear. Whenever God's reassurances are experienced as threat, it\n  is always because you are defending misplaced and misdirected\n  loyalty. That is what projection always involves. Error is lack of\n  love. When man projects this onto others, he does imprison\n  them, but only to the extent that he reinforces errors they have\n  already made. This makes them vulnerable to the distortions of\n  others since their own perception of themselves is distorted.\n  The miracle worker can only bless and this undoes their\n  distortions and frees them from prison.\n\n  37. 54 Miracles are examples of right\n  thinking. Reality contact at all levels becomes strong and accurate,\n  thus permitting correct delineation of intra- and interpersonal\n  boundaries. As a result, the doer's perceptions are aligned with\n  truth as God created it.\n\n  38. 55 A miracle is a correction\n  factor introduced into false thinking by me. It acts as a catalyst,\n  shaking up erroneous perception and reorganizing it properly. This\n  places man under the Atonement principle, where his perception is\n  healed. Until this has occurred, revelation of the divine order is\n  impossible.\n\n  39. 56 The Spiritual eye is the\n  mechanism of miracles because what It perceives is true. It\n  perceives both the creations of God and the creations of man. Among\n  the creations of man, it can also separate the true from the false by\n  Its ability to perceive totally rather than selectively. It thus\n  becomes the proper instrument for reality testing, which always\n  involves the necessary distinction between the false and the\n  true.\n\n  40. 57 The miracle dissolves error\n  because the Spiritual eye identifies error as false or unreal. This\n  is the same as saying that by perceiving light, darkness\n  automatically disappears.\n\n  58 Darkness is lack of light,\n  as sin is lack of love. It has no unique properties of its own. It is\n  an example of the \"scarcity\" fallacy, from which\n  only error can proceed. Truth is always abundant. Those who\n  perceive and acknowledge that they have everything have no need for\n  driven behavior of any kind.\n\n  41. 59 The miracle acknowledges all\n  men as your brothers and mine. It is a way of perceiving the\n  universal mark of God in them. The specialness of God's Sons does\n  not stem from exclusion but from inclusion. All my\n  brothers are special. If they believe they are deprived of anything,\n  their perception becomes distorted. When this occurs, the whole\n  family of God, or the Sonship, is impaired in its relationships.\n  Ultimately, every member of the family of God must return. The\n  miracle calls him to return because it blesses and honors him even\n  though he may be absent in spirit.\n\n  60 \"God is not\n  mocked\" is not a warning but a reassurance on this point. God\n  would be mocked if any of His creations lacked holiness. The\n  creation is whole, and the mark of wholeness is holiness.\n\n  42. 61 Wholeness is the perceptual\n  content of miracles. It thus corrects or atones for the faulty\n  perception of lack anywhere.\n\n  62 Here we begin to make the\n  fundamental distinction between miracles and projection. The stimulus\n  must precede the response and will also determine the kind of\n  response that is evoked. Behavior is response, so that the\n  question \"response to what?\" becomes crucial. Since stimuli\n  are identified through perception, you first perceive the stimulus\n  and then behave accordingly. It follows, then, that:\n\n  63 As ye perceive,So shall ye behave.\n\n  64 The Golden Rule asks you\n  to behave toward others as you would have them behave toward you.\n  This means that the perception of both must be accurate. The\n  Golden Rule is the rule for appropriate behavior. You cannot behave\n  appropriately unless you perceive accurately, because appropriate\n  behavior depends on lack of level confusion. The presence of\n  level confusion always results in variable reality testing and\n  therefore in variability in behavioral appropriateness. Since you and\n  your neighbor are equal members of the same family, as you perceive\n  both, so you will behave toward both. The way to perceive for Golden\n  Rule behavior is to look out from the perception of your own\n  holiness and perceive the holiness of others.\n\n  65 The emptiness engendered\n  by fear should be replaced by love because love and its absence are\n  in the same dimension, and correction cannot be undertaken except\n  within a dimension. Otherwise, there has been a confusion of levels. Death is a human affirmation of a belief in fate, or level confusion. That is why the Bible says, \"There is no\n  death\" and why I demonstrated that death does not exist. I came\n  to fulfill the law by reinterpreting it. The law itself, if\n  properly understood, offers only protection to man. It is those who\n  have not yet \"changed their minds\" who entered the\n  \"hellfire\" concept into it.\n\n  66 I assure you that I\n  will witness for anyone who lets me and to whatever extent he permits\n  it. Your witnessing demonstrates your belief and thus\n  strengthens it. Those who witness for me are expressing through their\n  miracles that they have abandoned the belief in deprivation in favor\n  of the abundance they have learned belongs to them.\n\n  43. 67 A major contribution of\n  miracles is their strength in releasing man from his misplaced sense\n  of isolation, deprivation, and lack.\n\n  68 Miracles are affirmations\n  of Sonship, which is a state of completion and abundance. Whatever is\n  true and real is eternal and cannot change or be\n  changed. The Soul is therefore unalterable because it is already\n  perfect, but the mind can elect the level it chooses to serve. The\n  only limit which is put on its choice is that it cannot\n  serve two masters.\n\n  69 The mind, if it elects to\n  do so, becomes a medium by which the Soul creates along the line of\n  its own creation. If it does not freely elect to do so, it retains\n  its creative potential but places itself under tyrannous\n  rather than genuinely authoritative control. As a result it\n  imprisons, because such are the dictates of tyrants. To change your\n  mind means to place it at the disposal of true Authority.\n\n  70 The miracle is thus a sign\n  that the mind has chosen to be led by Christ in His service. The\n  abundance of Christ is the natural result of choosing to follow Him.\n  All shallow roots must be uprooted because they are not deep\n  enough to sustain you. The illusion that shallow roots can be\n  deepened and thus made to hold is one of the distortions on\n  which the reversal of the Golden Rule rests. As these false\n  underpinnings are given up, the equilibrium is temporarily\n  experienced as unstable. However, the fact is that nothing is\n  less stable than an orientation that is upside down. Nor can anything\n  which holds it that way be really conducive to greater stability.\n\n  44. 71 Miracles arise from a\n  miraculous state of mind. By being one, this state of mind goes out\n  to anyone, even without the awareness of the miracle worker\n  himself. The impersonal nature of miracles is because the Atonement\n  itself is one, uniting all creations with their Creator.\n\n  45. 72 The miracle is an expression\n  of an inner awareness of Christ and the acceptance of His Atonement.\n  The mind is then in a state of grace and naturally becomes gracious\n  both to the host within and the stranger without. By bringing in the\n  stranger, he becomes your brother.\n\n  46. 73 A miracle is never lost. It\n  touches many people you do not even know and sometimes produces\n  undreamed of changes in forces of which you are not even aware. That\n  is not your concern. The miracle will always bless you.\n\n  74 The miracles you are\n  not asked to perform have not lost their value. They are still\n  expressions of your own state of grace, but the action aspect\n  of the miracle should be Christ-controlled because of His complete\n  awareness of the whole plan. The impersonal nature of\n  miracle-mindedness ensures your grace, but only Christ is in a\n  position to know where grace can be bestowed.\n\n  47. 75 Miracle-mindedness means\n  miracle-readiness. Readiness means that you should always keep your\n  perceptions straight, so that you will always be ready,\n  willing, and able. These are the essentials for \"listen, learn,\n  and do.\" You must be ready to listen, willing to\n  learn, and able to do. Only the last is involuntary because it\n  is the application of miracles which must be\n  Christ-controlled. The other two, which are the voluntary\n  aspects of miracle-mindedness, are up to you.\n\n  48. 76 Awe is an inappropriate\n  response to miracles.\n\n  77 Revelation is literally\n  unspeakable because it is an experience of unspeakable love. Awe\n  should be reserved for revelation, to which it is perfectly and\n  correctly applicable. It is not appropriate for miracles\n  because a state of awe is worshipful. It implies that one of a lesser\n  order stands before a greater one. This is the case only when\n  a Soul stands before its Creator. Souls are perfect creations and\n  experience awe only in the Presence of the Creator of perfection.\n\n  78 The miracle, on the other\n  hand, is a sign of love among equals. Equals cannot be in awe of one\n  another because awe implies inequality. It is therefore an\n  inappropriate reaction to me. An elder brother is entitled to respect\n  for his greater experience and a reasonable amount of obedience for\n  his greater wisdom. He is also entitled to love because he is\n  a brother and also to devotion if he is devoted. It is only my\n  devotion that entitles me to yours. There is nothing about me that\n  you cannot attain. I have nothing that does not come from God.\n  The main difference between us as yet is that I have nothing\n  else. This leaves me in a state of true holiness, which is only a\n  potential in you.\n\n  79 \"No man cometh unto\n  the Father but by me\" is among the most misunderstood statements\n  in the Bible. It does not mean that I am in any way separate\n  or different from you except in time, which does not really\n  exist at all. Actually, the quotation is more meaningful if it is\n  considered on a vertical rather than a horizontal axis. Regarded\n  along the vertical, man stands below me and I stand below God. In the\n  process of \"rising up,\" I am higher. This is\n  because, without me, the distance between God and man would be too\n  great for you to encompass.\n\n  80 I bridge the distance as\n  an elder brother to man on the one hand and as a Son of God on the\n  other. My devotion to my brothers has placed me in charge of the\n  Sonship, which I can render complete only to the extent to which I\n  can share it. This may appear to contradict the statement,\n  \"I and my Father are one,\" but there are still separate\n  parts in the statement in recognition that the Father is greater.\n  (The original statement was \"are of one kind\"). The Holy\n  Spirit is the bringer of revelations. Revelations are\n  indirectly inspired by me because I am close to the Holy\n  Spirit and alert to the revelation-readiness of my brothers. I can\n  thus bring down to them more than they can draw down to\n  themselves.\n\n  49. 81 The Holy Spirit is the highest\n  communication medium. Miracles do not involve this type of\n  communication because they are temporary communication\n  devices. When man returns to his original form of communication with\n  God, the need for miracles is over. The Holy Spirit mediates higher\n  to lower communication, keeping the direct channel from God to man\n  open for revelation. Revelation is not reciprocal. It is always\n  from God to man. The miracle is reciprocal\n  because it involves equality.\n\n  50. 82 The miracle is a learning\n  device which lessens the need for time. In the longitudinal or\n  horizontal plane, the recognition of the true equality of all the\n  members of the Sonship appears to involve almost endless time.\n  However, the sudden shift from horizontal to vertical perception\n  which the miracle entails introduces an interval from which the doer\n  and the receiver both emerge much farther along in time than\n  they would otherwise have been.\n\n  83 The miracle thus has the\n  unique property of shortening time by rendering the space of time it\n  occupies unnecessary. There is no relationship between the\n  time a miracle takes and the time it covers. It\n  substitutes for learning that might have taken thousands of years. It\n  does this by the underlying recognition of perfect equality and\n  holiness between the doer and the receiver on which the miracle\n  rests.\n\n  84 We said before that the\n  miracle abolishes time. It does this by a process of\n  collapsing it and thus abolishing certain intervals\n  within it. It does this, however, within the larger temporal\n  sequence. It establishes an out-of-pattern time interval which is\n  not under the usual laws of time. Only in this sense is it\n  timeless. By collapsing time, it literally saves time. Much as\n  daylight saving time does, it rearranges the distribution of\n  light.\n\n  51. 85 The miracle is the only device\n  which man has at his immediate disposal for controlling time. Only\n  revelation transcends time, having nothing to do with time at\n  all.\n\n  86 The miracle is much like\n  the body in that both are learning aids which aim at facilitating a\n  state in which they are unnecessary. When the Soul's original\n  state of direct communication is reached, neither the body nor the\n  miracle serves any purpose. While he believes he is in a body,\n  however, man can choose between loveless and miraculous channels of\n  expression. He can make an empty shell, but he cannot express\n  nothing at all. He can wait, delay, paralyze himself, reduce his\n  creativity to almost nothing, and even introduce a developmental\n  arrest or even a regression. But he cannot abolish his\n  creativity. He can destroy his medium of communication but not\n  his potential.\n\n  87 Man was not created\n  by his own free will alone. Only what he creates is his to\n  decide. The basic decision of the miracle-minded is not to wait on\n  time any longer than is necessary. Time can waste as well as be\n  wasted. The miracle-worker, therefore, accepts the time-control\n  factor gladly because he recognizes that every collapse of time\n  brings all men closer to the ultimate release from time in\n  which the Son and the Father are one.\n\n  88 Equality does not imply\n  homogeneity now. When everyone recognizes that he has\n  everything, individual contributions to the Sonship will no longer be\n  necessary. When the Atonement has been completed, all talents\n  will be shared by all the Sons of God. God is not\n  partial. All His Children have His total love, and all His\n  gifts are freely given to everyone alike. \"Except ye become as\n  little children\" means that, unless you fully recognize your\n  complete dependence on God, you cannot know the real power of the Son\n  in his true relationship with the Father.\n\n  89 You who want peace can\n  find it only by complete forgiveness. You never really wanted\n  peace before, so there was no point in being told how to achieve it.\n  No learning is acquired by anyone unless he wants to learn it and\n  believes in some way that he needs it. While the concept of\n  lack does not exist in the creation of God, it is very\n  apparent in the creations of man. It is, in fact, the essential\n  difference. A need implies lack by definition. It involves the\n  recognition that you would be better off in a state which is somehow\n  different from the one you are in.\n\n  90 Until the\n  \"separation,\" which is a better term than the\n  \"fall,\" nothing was lacking. This meant that man had no\n  needs at all. If he had not deprived himself, he would never have\n  experienced them. After the separation, needs became the most\n  powerful source of motivation for human action. All behavior is\n  essentially motivated by needs, but behavior itself is not a divine\n  attribute. The body is the mechanism for behavior. The belief that he\n  could be better off is the reason why man has this mechanism\n  at his disposal.\n\n  91 Each one acts according to\n  the particular hierarchy of needs he establishes for himself. His\n  hierarchy, in turn, depends on his perception of what he\n  is\u0097that is, what he lacks. A sense of separation\n  from God is the only lack he really needs to correct. This\n  sense of separation would never have occurred if he had not distorted\n  his perception of truth and thus perceived himself as lacking.\n  The concept of any sort of need hierarchy arose because,\n  having made this fundamental error, he had already fragmented himself\n  into levels with different needs. As he integrates he becomes\n  one, and his needs become one accordingly.\n\n  92 Unified need produces\n  unified action because it produces a lack of ambivalence. The concept\n  of a need hierarchy, a corollary to the original error that man can\n  be separated from God, requires correction at its own level before\n  the error of perceiving levels at all can be corrected. Man cannot\n  behave effectively while he operates at split levels. However, while\n  he does, correction must be introduced from the bottom up.\n  This is because he now operates in space, where concepts such as\n  \"up\" and \"down\" are meaningful. Ultimately, space\n  is as meaningless as time. The concept is really one of space-time\n  belief.\n\n  93 The physical world exists\n  only because man can use it to correct his unbelief, which\n  placed him in it originally. He can never control the effects of fear\n  himself because he made fear and believes in what he made. In\n  attitude, then, though not in content, he resembles his own\n  Creator, Who has perfect faith in His creations because He\n  created them. Belief in a creation produces its existence. That is\n  why a man can believe in what no one else thinks is true. It is true\n  for him because it was made by him.\n\n  94 Every aspect of fear\n  proceeds from upside-down perception. The more truly creative devote\n  their efforts to correcting perceptual distortions. The neurotic\n  devotes his to compromise. The psychotic tries to escape by\n  establishing the certain truth of his own errors. It is most\n  difficult to free him by ordinary means because he is more consistent\n  in his own denial of truth. The miracle, however, makes no such\n  distinctions. It corrects errors because they are errors.\n  Thus, the next point to remember about miracles is:\n\n  52. 95 The miracle makes no\n  distinction among degrees of misperception. It is a device for\n  perception-correction, effective quite apart from either the degree\n  or the direction of the error. This is its true\n  indiscriminateness.\n\n  96 Christ-controlled miracles\n  are selective only in the sense that they are directed towards\n  those who can use them for themselves. Since this makes it\n  inevitable that they will extend them to others, a strong chain of\n  Atonement is welded. However, Christ-control takes no account at all\n  of the magnitude of the miracle itself because the concept of size\n  exists in a plane that is itself unreal. Since the miracle aims at\n  restoring the awareness of reality, it would hardly be useful\n  if it were bound by the laws which govern the error it aims to\n  correct. Only man makes this kind of mistake. It is an example of the\n  foolish consistency which his own false beliefs have engendered.\n\n  97 The power and strength of\n  man's creative will must be understood before the real meaning of\n  denial can be appreciated and relinquished. It is not mere\n  negation. It is a positive miscreation. While the miscreation is\n  necessarily believed in by its maker, it does not exist at all\n  at the level of true creation.\n\n  53. 98 The miracle compares what man\n  has made with the higher level creation, accepting what is in\n  accord as true and rejecting the discord as false.\n  All aspects of fear are untrue because they do not exist at\n  the higher creative level, and therefore do not exist at all. To\n  whatever extent a man is willing to submit his beliefs to this test,\n  to that extent are perceptions corrected.\n\n  99 In sorting out the false\n  from the true, the miracle proceeds along the following lines:\n\n  100 If perfect love casts out fear,  And if fear exists,  Then there is not perfect\n  love.  But only perfect love really\n  exists.  If there is fear,  It creates a state which does not\n  exist.\n\n  101 Believe this and you will be\n  free. Only God can establish this solution, and this faith\n  is His gift.\n  \n    [1] The term \"Spiritual eye\" is\n    later replaced by the Holy Spirit, and the \"physical eye\"\n    becomes the ego. The emphasis on the two ways of seeing, however,\n    remains throughout.\n  \n  ","title":"Chapter One: Introduction to MiraclesI. Principles of Miracles"}

         * description :
         Chapter One: Introduction to MiraclesI. Principles of Miracles
         1.1 There is no order of difficulty
         among miracles. One is not "harder" or "bigger"
         than another. They are all the same. All expressions of love are
         maximal.
         2. 2 Miracles as such do not matter.
         The only thing that matters is their Source, Which is far beyond
         human evaluation.

         3. 3 Miracles occur naturally as
         expressions of love. The real miracle is the love that inspires them.
         In this sense, everything that comes from love is a miracle.

         4 4 All miracles mean life, and God
         is the Giver of life. His Voice will direct you very specifically.
         You will be told all you need to know.

         5. 5 Miracles are habits and should
         be involuntary. They should not be under conscious control.
         Consciously selected miracles can be misguided.

         6. 6 Miracles are natural. When they
         do not occur, something has gone wrong.

         7. 7 Miracles are everyone's
         right, but purification is necessary first.

         8. 8 Miracles are healing because they supply a lack in that they are performed by those who
         temporarily have more for those who temporarily have less.

         9. 9 Miracles are a kind of exchange.
         Like all expressions of love, which are always miraculous in
         the true sense, the exchange reverses the physical laws. They bring
         more love both to the giver and the receiver.

         10. 10 The use of miracles as
         spectacles to induce belief is wrong, or better, is a
         misunderstanding of their purpose. They are really used for
         and by believers.

         11. 11 Prayer is the medium of
         miracles. Prayer is the natural communication of the created with the
         Creator. Through prayer love is received, and through miracles love
         is expressed.

         12. 12 Miracles are thoughts.
         Thoughts can represent lower-order or higher-order reality. This is
         the basic distinction between intellectualizing and thinking. One
         makes the physical and the other creates the spiritual, and we
         believe in what we make or create.

         13. 13 Miracles are both beginnings
         and endings. They thus alter the temporal order. They are always
         affirmations of rebirth which seem to go back but really go forward.
         They undo the past in the present and thus release the future.

         14. 14 Miracles bear witness to
         truth. They are convincing because they arise from conviction.
         Without conviction they deteriorate into magic, which is mindless and
         therefore destructive, or rather the uncreative use of mind.

         15. 15 Each day should be devoted to
         miracles. The purpose of time is to enable man to learn to use it
         constructively. Time is thus a teaching device and a means to an end.
         It will cease when it is no longer useful in facilitating
         learning.

         16. 16 Miracles are teaching devices
         for demonstrating that it is more blessed to give than to receive.
         They simultaneously increase the strength of the giver and supply
         strength to the receiver.

         17. 17 Miracles are the transcendence
         of the body. They are sudden shifts into invisibility, away from a
         sense of lower-order reality. That is why they heal.

         18. 18 A miracle is a service. It is
         the maximal service one individual can render another. It is a way of
         loving your neighbor as yourself. The doer recognizes his own and his
         neighbor's inestimable worth simultaneously.

         19. 19 Miracles make minds one in
         God. They depend on cooperation because the Sonship is the sum of all
         the Souls God created. Miracles therefore rest on the laws of
         eternity, not of time.

         20. 20 Miracles reawaken the
         awareness that the spirit, not the body, is the altar of truth. This
         is the recognition that leads to the healing power of the
         miracle.

         21. 21 Miracles are natural
         expressions of total forgiveness. Through miracles, man accepts
         God's forgiveness by extending it to others.

         22. 22 Miracles are associated with
         fear only because of the fallacious belief that darkness can
         hide. Man believes that what he cannot see does not exist, and
         his physical eyes cannot see in the dark. This is a very primitive
         solution and has led to a denial of the Spiritual eye. [1] The escape from darkness involves two
         stages:

         A. 23 The recognition that darkness
         cannot hide. This step usually entails fear.

         B. 24 The recognition that there is
         nothing you want to hide, even if you could. This step
         brings escape from fear.

         23. 25 Miracles rearrange perception
         and place the levels of perception in true perspective. This heals at
         all levels because sickness comes from confusing the
         levels.

         26 When you have become
         willing to hide nothing, you will not only be willing to enter into
         communion but will also understand peace and joy. Your commitment is
         not yet total, and that is why you still have more to learn than to
         teach. When your equilibrium stabilizes, you will be able to teach as
         much as you learn, which will give you the proper balance. Meanwhile,
         remember that no effort is wasted, for unless you remember this, you
         cannot avail yourselves of my efforts, which are
         limitless. Only eternity is real. Why not use the illusion of time
         constructively?

         24. 27 Miracles enable man to heal
         the sick and raise the dead because he made sickness and death
         himself and can abolish both. You are a miracle, capable of
         creating in the likeness of your Creator. Everything else is only
         your own nightmare and does not exist. Only the creations of light
         are real.

         25. 28 Miracles are part of an
         interlocking chain of forgiveness which, when completed, is the
         Atonement. This process works all the time and in all the dimensions
         of time.

         29 I am in charge of the
         process of Atonement, which I undertook to begin. When you offer a
         miracle unto any of my brothers, you do it unto yourself and
         me. The reason you come before me is that I do not need
         miracles for my own Atonement, but I stand at the end in case you
         fail temporarily. The purpose of my part in the Atonement is the
         canceling out of all lacks of love which men could not otherwise
         correct. The word "sin" should be changed to "lack of
         love" because "sin" is a man-made word with threat
         connotations which he made up himself. No real threat is
         involved anywhere. Nothing is gained by frightening yourselves, and
         it is very destructive to do so.

         26. 30 Miracles represent
         freedom from fear. "Atoning" really means
         "undoing." The undoing of fear is an essential part of the
         Atonement value of miracles.

         31 The purpose of the
         Atonement is to restore everything to you, or rather to restore it to
         your awareness. You were given everything when you were created, just
         as everyone was. When you have been restored to the recognition of
         your original state, you naturally become part of the Atonement
         yourself. As you share my inability to tolerate lack of love in
         yourself and others, you must join the Great Crusade to correct it.
         The slogan for the Crusade is "Listen, learn and
         do": Listen to my voice, learn to undo error, and
         do something to correct it. The first two are not enough.
         The real members of my party are active
         workers.

         32 The power to work miracles
         belongs to you. I will provide the opportunities to do them,
         but you must be ready and willing since you are already able.
         Doing them will bring conviction in the ability since conviction
         really comes through accomplishment. The ability is the potential;
         the achievement is its expression; and the Atonement is the
         purpose.

         27. 33 A miracle is a universal
         blessing from God through me to all my brothers. It is the
         privilege of the forgiven to forgive.

         34 The disciples were
         specifically told to be physicians of the Lord and to heal others.
         They were also told to heal themselves and were promised that
         I would never leave them or forsake them. Atonement is the natural
         profession of the Children of God because they have professed me.
         "Heaven and earth shall pass away" simply means that they
         will not continue to exist as separate states. My word, which is the
         resurrection and the light, shall not pass away because light is
         eternal. You are the work of God, and His work is wholly
         lovable and wholly loving. This is how a man must think of
         himself in his heart because this is what he is.

         28. 35 Miracles are a means of
         organizing different levels of consciousness.

         36 Miracles come from the
         below or subconscious level. Revelations come from the above or
         superconscious level. The conscious level is in between and reacts to
         either sub- or superconscious impulses in varying ratios.
         Consciousness is the level which engages in the world and is capable
         of responding to both. Having no impulses from itself and being
         primarily a mechanism for inducing response, it can be very
         wrong.

         37 Revelation induces
         complete but temporary suspension of doubt and fear. It represents
         the original form of communication between God and His Souls,
         involving an extremely personal sense of closeness to creation which
         man tries to find in physical relationships. Physical closeness
         cannot achieve this. The subconscious impulses properly induce
         miracles, which are genuinely interpersonal and result in real
         closeness to others. This can be misunderstood by a personally
         willful consciousness as impulses toward physical gratification.

         38 Revelation unites Souls
         directly with God. Miracles unite minds directly with each other.
         Neither emanates from consciousness, but both are experienced
         there. This is essential since consciousness is the state which
         induces action, though it does not inspire it. Man is free to
         believe what he chooses, and what he does attests to what he
         believes. The deeper levels of the subconscious always contain
         the impulse to miracles, but man is free to fill its more superficial
         levels, which are closer to consciousness, with the impulses of this
         world and to identify himself with them. This results in
         denying himself access to the miracle level underneath. In his
         actions, then, his relationships also become superficial, and
         miracle-inspired relating becomes impossible.

         29. 39 Miracles are a way of
         earning release from fear.

         40 Revelation induces a state
         in which fear has already been abolished. Miracles are thus a
         means, and revelation is an end. [In this sense, they work together.]
         Miracles do not depend on revelation; they induce it.
         Revelation is intensely personal and cannot actually be translated
         into conscious content at all. That is why any attempt to describe it
         in words is usually incomprehensible. Revelation induces only
         experience. Miracles, on the other hand, induce [interpersonal]
         action. Miracles are more useful now because of their
         impersonal nature. In this phase of learning, working miracles
         is more important because freedom from fear cannot be thrust upon
         you.

         30. 41 Miracles praise God through
         men. They praise God by honoring His creations, affirming their
         perfection. They heal because they deny body-identification and
         affirm Soul-identification. By perceiving the spirit, they adjust the
         levels and see them in proper alignment. This places the spirit at
         the center, where Souls can communicate directly.

         31. 42 Miracles should inspire
         gratitude, not awe. Man should thank God for what he really is. The
         Children of God are very holy, and the miracle honors their
         holiness.

         43 God's creations never
         lose their holiness, although it can be hidden. The miracle uncovers
         it and brings it into the light where it belongs. Holiness can never
         be really hidden in darkness, but man can deceive himself about it.
         This illusion makes him fearful because he knows in his heart it is
         an illusion, and he exerts enormous efforts to establish its reality.
         The miracle sets reality where it belongs. Eternal reality belongs
         only to the Soul, and the miracle acknowledges only the truth. It
         thus dispels man's illusions about himself and puts him in
         communion with himself and God.

         32. 44 Christ inspires all miracles,
         which are really intercessions. They intercede for man's holiness
         and make his perceptions holy. By placing him beyond the physical
         laws, they raise him into the sphere of celestial order. In
         this order, man is perfect.

         45 The Soul never loses its
         communion with God. Only the mind needs Atonement. The miracle
         joins in the Atonement of Christ by placing the mind in the service
         of the spirit. This establishes the proper function of the mind and
         corrects its errors.

         33. 46 Miracles honor man
         because he is lovable. They dispel illusions about him and
         perceive the light in him. They thus atone for his errors by freeing
         him from his own nightmares. They release him from a prison in which
         he has imprisoned himself, and by freeing his mind from
         illusions, they restore his sanity. Man's mind can be
         possessed by illusions, but his spirit is eternally free. If a mind
         perceives without love, it perceives an empty shell and is unaware of
         the spirit within it. But the Atonement restores the Soul to its
         proper place. The mind that serves the spirit is invulnerable.

         34. 47 Miracles restore the mind to
         its fullness. By atoning for lack, they establish perfect protection.
         The strength of the Soul leaves no room for intrusions. The forgiven
         are filled with the Soul, and they forgive in return. It is the duty
         of the released to release their brothers.

         48 The forgiven are
         the means of Atonement. Those released by Christ must join in
         releasing their brothers, for this is the plan of the Atonement.
         Miracles are the way in which minds which serve the spirit unite with
         Christ for the salvation or release of all God's creations.

         35. 49 Miracles are expressions of
         love, but it does not follow that they will [be effective]. I am the only one who can perform miracles indiscriminately because I am the Atonement. You have a
         role in the Atonement, which I will dictate to you. Ask
         me which miracles you should perform. This spares you
         exhaustion because you will act under direct communication.

         36. 50 Christ-controlled miracles are
         part of the Atonement, but Christ-guidance is personal and leads to
         personal salvation. The impersonal nature of miracles is an
         essential ingredient because this enables me to control their
         distribution. Christ-guidance leads to the highly personal
         experience of revelation. This is why it involves personal
         choice. A guide does not control, but he does direct,
         leaving the following up to you. "Lead us not into
         temptation" means "guide us out of our own errors."
         "Take up thy cross and follow me" means, "Recognize
         your errors and choose to abandon them by following my
         guidance."

         51 Remember that error cannot
         really threaten truth, which can always withstand it.
         Only the error is really vulnerable. You are free to establish
         your kingdom where you see fit, but the right choice is inevitable if
         you remember this:

         52 The Soul is in a state of grace forever. Man's reality is only his Soul. Therefore, man is in a state of grace forever.

         53 Atonement undoes all
         errors in this respect and thus uproots the real source of
         fear. Whenever God's reassurances are experienced as threat, it
         is always because you are defending misplaced and misdirected
         loyalty. That is what projection always involves. Error is lack of
         love. When man projects this onto others, he does imprison
         them, but only to the extent that he reinforces errors they have
         already made. This makes them vulnerable to the distortions of
         others since their own perception of themselves is distorted.
         The miracle worker can only bless and this undoes their
         distortions and frees them from prison.

         37. 54 Miracles are examples of right
         thinking. Reality contact at all levels becomes strong and accurate,
         thus permitting correct delineation of intra- and interpersonal
         boundaries. As a result, the doer's perceptions are aligned with
         truth as God created it.

         38. 55 A miracle is a correction
         factor introduced into false thinking by me. It acts as a catalyst,
         shaking up erroneous perception and reorganizing it properly. This
         places man under the Atonement principle, where his perception is
         healed. Until this has occurred, revelation of the divine order is
         impossible.

         39. 56 The Spiritual eye is the
         mechanism of miracles because what It perceives is true. It
         perceives both the creations of God and the creations of man. Among
         the creations of man, it can also separate the true from the false by
         Its ability to perceive totally rather than selectively. It thus
         becomes the proper instrument for reality testing, which always
         involves the necessary distinction between the false and the
         true.

         40. 57 The miracle dissolves error
         because the Spiritual eye identifies error as false or unreal. This
         is the same as saying that by perceiving light, darkness
         automatically disappears.

         58 Darkness is lack of light,
         as sin is lack of love. It has no unique properties of its own. It is
         an example of the "scarcity" fallacy, from which
         only error can proceed. Truth is always abundant. Those who
         perceive and acknowledge that they have everything have no need for
         driven behavior of any kind.

         41. 59 The miracle acknowledges all
         men as your brothers and mine. It is a way of perceiving the
         universal mark of God in them. The specialness of God's Sons does
         not stem from exclusion but from inclusion. All my
         brothers are special. If they believe they are deprived of anything,
         their perception becomes distorted. When this occurs, the whole
         family of God, or the Sonship, is impaired in its relationships.
         Ultimately, every member of the family of God must return. The
         miracle calls him to return because it blesses and honors him even
         though he may be absent in spirit.

         60 "God is not
         mocked" is not a warning but a reassurance on this point. God
         would be mocked if any of His creations lacked holiness. The
         creation is whole, and the mark of wholeness is holiness.

         42. 61 Wholeness is the perceptual
         content of miracles. It thus corrects or atones for the faulty
         perception of lack anywhere.

         62 Here we begin to make the
         fundamental distinction between miracles and projection. The stimulus
         must precede the response and will also determine the kind of
         response that is evoked. Behavior is response, so that the
         question "response to what?" becomes crucial. Since stimuli
         are identified through perception, you first perceive the stimulus
         and then behave accordingly. It follows, then, that:

         63 As ye perceive,So shall ye behave.

         64 The Golden Rule asks you
         to behave toward others as you would have them behave toward you.
         This means that the perception of both must be accurate. The
         Golden Rule is the rule for appropriate behavior. You cannot behave
         appropriately unless you perceive accurately, because appropriate
         behavior depends on lack of level confusion. The presence of
         level confusion always results in variable reality testing and
         therefore in variability in behavioral appropriateness. Since you and
         your neighbor are equal members of the same family, as you perceive
         both, so you will behave toward both. The way to perceive for Golden
         Rule behavior is to look out from the perception of your own
         holiness and perceive the holiness of others.

         65 The emptiness engendered
         by fear should be replaced by love because love and its absence are
         in the same dimension, and correction cannot be undertaken except
         within a dimension. Otherwise, there has been a confusion of levels. Death is a human affirmation of a belief in fate, or level confusion. That is why the Bible says, "There is no
         death" and why I demonstrated that death does not exist. I came
         to fulfill the law by reinterpreting it. The law itself, if
         properly understood, offers only protection to man. It is those who
         have not yet "changed their minds" who entered the
         "hellfire" concept into it.

         66 I assure you that I
         will witness for anyone who lets me and to whatever extent he permits
         it. Your witnessing demonstrates your belief and thus
         strengthens it. Those who witness for me are expressing through their
         miracles that they have abandoned the belief in deprivation in favor
         of the abundance they have learned belongs to them.

         43. 67 A major contribution of
         miracles is their strength in releasing man from his misplaced sense
         of isolation, deprivation, and lack.

         68 Miracles are affirmations
         of Sonship, which is a state of completion and abundance. Whatever is
         true and real is eternal and cannot change or be
         changed. The Soul is therefore unalterable because it is already
         perfect, but the mind can elect the level it chooses to serve. The
         only limit which is put on its choice is that it cannot
         serve two masters.

         69 The mind, if it elects to
         do so, becomes a medium by which the Soul creates along the line of
         its own creation. If it does not freely elect to do so, it retains
         its creative potential but places itself under tyrannous
         rather than genuinely authoritative control. As a result it
         imprisons, because such are the dictates of tyrants. To change your
         mind means to place it at the disposal of true Authority.

         70 The miracle is thus a sign
         that the mind has chosen to be led by Christ in His service. The
         abundance of Christ is the natural result of choosing to follow Him.
         All shallow roots must be uprooted because they are not deep
         enough to sustain you. The illusion that shallow roots can be
         deepened and thus made to hold is one of the distortions on
         which the reversal of the Golden Rule rests. As these false
         underpinnings are given up, the equilibrium is temporarily
         experienced as unstable. However, the fact is that nothing is
         less stable than an orientation that is upside down. Nor can anything
         which holds it that way be really conducive to greater stability.

         44. 71 Miracles arise from a
         miraculous state of mind. By being one, this state of mind goes out
         to anyone, even without the awareness of the miracle worker
         himself. The impersonal nature of miracles is because the Atonement
         itself is one, uniting all creations with their Creator.

         45. 72 The miracle is an expression
         of an inner awareness of Christ and the acceptance of His Atonement.
         The mind is then in a state of grace and naturally becomes gracious
         both to the host within and the stranger without. By bringing in the
         stranger, he becomes your brother.

         46. 73 A miracle is never lost. It
         touches many people you do not even know and sometimes produces
         undreamed of changes in forces of which you are not even aware. That
         is not your concern. The miracle will always bless you.

         74 The miracles you are
         not asked to perform have not lost their value. They are still
         expressions of your own state of grace, but the action aspect
         of the miracle should be Christ-controlled because of His complete
         awareness of the whole plan. The impersonal nature of
         miracle-mindedness ensures your grace, but only Christ is in a
         position to know where grace can be bestowed.

         47. 75 Miracle-mindedness means
         miracle-readiness. Readiness means that you should always keep your
         perceptions straight, so that you will always be ready,
         willing, and able. These are the essentials for "listen, learn,
         and do." You must be ready to listen, willing to
         learn, and able to do. Only the last is involuntary because it
         is the application of miracles which must be
         Christ-controlled. The other two, which are the voluntary
         aspects of miracle-mindedness, are up to you.

         48. 76 Awe is an inappropriate
         response to miracles.

         77 Revelation is literally
         unspeakable because it is an experience of unspeakable love. Awe
         should be reserved for revelation, to which it is perfectly and
         correctly applicable. It is not appropriate for miracles
         because a state of awe is worshipful. It implies that one of a lesser
         order stands before a greater one. This is the case only when
         a Soul stands before its Creator. Souls are perfect creations and
         experience awe only in the Presence of the Creator of perfection.

         78 The miracle, on the other
         hand, is a sign of love among equals. Equals cannot be in awe of one
         another because awe implies inequality. It is therefore an
         inappropriate reaction to me. An elder brother is entitled to respect
         for his greater experience and a reasonable amount of obedience for
         his greater wisdom. He is also entitled to love because he is
         a brother and also to devotion if he is devoted. It is only my
         devotion that entitles me to yours. There is nothing about me that
         you cannot attain. I have nothing that does not come from God.
         The main difference between us as yet is that I have nothing
         else. This leaves me in a state of true holiness, which is only a
         potential in you.

         79 "No man cometh unto
         the Father but by me" is among the most misunderstood statements
         in the Bible. It does not mean that I am in any way separate
         or different from you except in time, which does not really
         exist at all. Actually, the quotation is more meaningful if it is
         considered on a vertical rather than a horizontal axis. Regarded
         along the vertical, man stands below me and I stand below God. In the
         process of "rising up," I am higher. This is
         because, without me, the distance between God and man would be too
         great for you to encompass.

         80 I bridge the distance as
         an elder brother to man on the one hand and as a Son of God on the
         other. My devotion to my brothers has placed me in charge of the
         Sonship, which I can render complete only to the extent to which I
         can share it. This may appear to contradict the statement,
         "I and my Father are one," but there are still separate
         parts in the statement in recognition that the Father is greater.
         (The original statement was "are of one kind"). The Holy
         Spirit is the bringer of revelations. Revelations are
         indirectly inspired by me because I am close to the Holy
         Spirit and alert to the revelation-readiness of my brothers. I can
         thus bring down to them more than they can draw down to
         themselves.

         49. 81 The Holy Spirit is the highest
         communication medium. Miracles do not involve this type of
         communication because they are temporary communication
         devices. When man returns to his original form of communication with
         God, the need for miracles is over. The Holy Spirit mediates higher
         to lower communication, keeping the direct channel from God to man
         open for revelation. Revelation is not reciprocal. It is always
         from God to man. The miracle is reciprocal
         because it involves equality.

         50. 82 The miracle is a learning
         device which lessens the need for time. In the longitudinal or
         horizontal plane, the recognition of the true equality of all the
         members of the Sonship appears to involve almost endless time.
         However, the sudden shift from horizontal to vertical perception
         which the miracle entails introduces an interval from which the doer
         and the receiver both emerge much farther along in time than
         they would otherwise have been.

         83 The miracle thus has the
         unique property of shortening time by rendering the space of time it
         occupies unnecessary. There is no relationship between the
         time a miracle takes and the time it covers. It
         substitutes for learning that might have taken thousands of years. It
         does this by the underlying recognition of perfect equality and
         holiness between the doer and the receiver on which the miracle
         rests.

         84 We said before that the
         miracle abolishes time. It does this by a process of
         collapsing it and thus abolishing certain intervals
         within it. It does this, however, within the larger temporal
         sequence. It establishes an out-of-pattern time interval which is
         not under the usual laws of time. Only in this sense is it
         timeless. By collapsing time, it literally saves time. Much as
         daylight saving time does, it rearranges the distribution of
         light.

         51. 85 The miracle is the only device
         which man has at his immediate disposal for controlling time. Only
         revelation transcends time, having nothing to do with time at
         all.

         86 The miracle is much like
         the body in that both are learning aids which aim at facilitating a
         state in which they are unnecessary. When the Soul's original
         state of direct communication is reached, neither the body nor the
         miracle serves any purpose. While he believes he is in a body,
         however, man can choose between loveless and miraculous channels of
         expression. He can make an empty shell, but he cannot express
         nothing at all. He can wait, delay, paralyze himself, reduce his
         creativity to almost nothing, and even introduce a developmental
         arrest or even a regression. But he cannot abolish his
         creativity. He can destroy his medium of communication but not
         his potential.

         87 Man was not created
         by his own free will alone. Only what he creates is his to
         decide. The basic decision of the miracle-minded is not to wait on
         time any longer than is necessary. Time can waste as well as be
         wasted. The miracle-worker, therefore, accepts the time-control
         factor gladly because he recognizes that every collapse of time
         brings all men closer to the ultimate release from time in
         which the Son and the Father are one.

         88 Equality does not imply
         homogeneity now. When everyone recognizes that he has
         everything, individual contributions to the Sonship will no longer be
         necessary. When the Atonement has been completed, all talents
         will be shared by all the Sons of God. God is not
         partial. All His Children have His total love, and all His
         gifts are freely given to everyone alike. "Except ye become as
         little children" means that, unless you fully recognize your
         complete dependence on God, you cannot know the real power of the Son
         in his true relationship with the Father.

         89 You who want peace can
         find it only by complete forgiveness. You never really wanted
         peace before, so there was no point in being told how to achieve it.
         No learning is acquired by anyone unless he wants to learn it and
         believes in some way that he needs it. While the concept of
         lack does not exist in the creation of God, it is very
         apparent in the creations of man. It is, in fact, the essential
         difference. A need implies lack by definition. It involves the
         recognition that you would be better off in a state which is somehow
         different from the one you are in.

         90 Until the
         "separation," which is a better term than the
         "fall," nothing was lacking. This meant that man had no
         needs at all. If he had not deprived himself, he would never have
         experienced them. After the separation, needs became the most
         powerful source of motivation for human action. All behavior is
         essentially motivated by needs, but behavior itself is not a divine
         attribute. The body is the mechanism for behavior. The belief that he
         could be better off is the reason why man has this mechanism
         at his disposal.

         91 Each one acts according to
         the particular hierarchy of needs he establishes for himself. His
         hierarchy, in turn, depends on his perception of what he
         isthat is, what he lacks. A sense of separation
         from God is the only lack he really needs to correct. This
         sense of separation would never have occurred if he had not distorted
         his perception of truth and thus perceived himself as lacking.
         The concept of any sort of need hierarchy arose because,
         having made this fundamental error, he had already fragmented himself
         into levels with different needs. As he integrates he becomes
         one, and his needs become one accordingly.

         92 Unified need produces
         unified action because it produces a lack of ambivalence. The concept
         of a need hierarchy, a corollary to the original error that man can
         be separated from God, requires correction at its own level before
         the error of perceiving levels at all can be corrected. Man cannot
         behave effectively while he operates at split levels. However, while
         he does, correction must be introduced from the bottom up.
         This is because he now operates in space, where concepts such as
         "up" and "down" are meaningful. Ultimately, space
         is as meaningless as time. The concept is really one of space-time
         belief.

         93 The physical world exists
         only because man can use it to correct his unbelief, which
         placed him in it originally. He can never control the effects of fear
         himself because he made fear and believes in what he made. In
         attitude, then, though not in content, he resembles his own
         Creator, Who has perfect faith in His creations because He
         created them. Belief in a creation produces its existence. That is
         why a man can believe in what no one else thinks is true. It is true
         for him because it was made by him.

         94 Every aspect of fear
         proceeds from upside-down perception. The more truly creative devote
         their efforts to correcting perceptual distortions. The neurotic
         devotes his to compromise. The psychotic tries to escape by
         establishing the certain truth of his own errors. It is most
         difficult to free him by ordinary means because he is more consistent
         in his own denial of truth. The miracle, however, makes no such
         distinctions. It corrects errors because they are errors.
         Thus, the next point to remember about miracles is:

         52. 95 The miracle makes no
         distinction among degrees of misperception. It is a device for
         perception-correction, effective quite apart from either the degree
         or the direction of the error. This is its true
         indiscriminateness.

         96 Christ-controlled miracles
         are selective only in the sense that they are directed towards
         those who can use them for themselves. Since this makes it
         inevitable that they will extend them to others, a strong chain of
         Atonement is welded. However, Christ-control takes no account at all
         of the magnitude of the miracle itself because the concept of size
         exists in a plane that is itself unreal. Since the miracle aims at
         restoring the awareness of reality, it would hardly be useful
         if it were bound by the laws which govern the error it aims to
         correct. Only man makes this kind of mistake. It is an example of the
         foolish consistency which his own false beliefs have engendered.

         97 The power and strength of
         man's creative will must be understood before the real meaning of
         denial can be appreciated and relinquished. It is not mere
         negation. It is a positive miscreation. While the miscreation is
         necessarily believed in by its maker, it does not exist at all
         at the level of true creation.

         53. 98 The miracle compares what man
         has made with the higher level creation, accepting what is in
         accord as true and rejecting the discord as false.
         All aspects of fear are untrue because they do not exist at
         the higher creative level, and therefore do not exist at all. To
         whatever extent a man is willing to submit his beliefs to this test,
         to that extent are perceptions corrected.

         99 In sorting out the false
         from the true, the miracle proceeds along the following lines:

         100 If perfect love casts out fear,  And if fear exists,  Then there is not perfect
         love.  But only perfect love really
         exists.  If there is fear,  It creates a state which does not
         exist.

         101 Believe this and you will be
         free. Only God can establish this solution, and this faith
         is His gift.

         [1] The term "Spiritual eye" is
         later replaced by the Holy Spirit, and the "physical eye"
         becomes the ego. The emphasis on the two ways of seeing, however,
         remains throughout.
