         Introduction
         1 The role of teaching and
         learning is actually reversed in the thinking of the world. The
         reversal is characteristic. It seems as if the teacher and the
         learner are separated, the teacher giving something to the learner
         rather than to himself. Further, the act of teaching is regarded as a
         special activity in which one engages only a relatively small
         proportion of one's time. The course, on the other hand,
         emphasizes that to teach is to learn, so that teacher and learner are
         the same. It also emphasizes that teaching is a constant
         processÂ—it goes on every moment of the day and continues into
         sleeping thoughts as well.

         2 To teach is to demonstrate.
         There are only two thought systems, and you demonstrate that you
         believe one or the other is true all the time. From your
         demonstration, others learn and so do you. The question is not
         whether you will teach, for in that there is no choice. The purpose
         of the course might be said to provide you with a means of choosing
         what you want to teach on the basis of what you want to learn. You
         cannot give to someone else, and this you learn through teaching.
         Teaching is but a call to witnesses to attest to what you believe. It
         is a method of conversion. This is not done by words alone. Any
         situation must be to you a chance to teach others what you are and
         what they are to you. No more than that, but also never less.

         3 The curriculum that you set
         up is therefore determined exclusively by what you think you are and
         what you believe the relationship of others is to you. In the formal
         teaching situation, these questions may be totally unrelated to what
         you think you are teaching. Yet it is impossible not to use the
         content of any situation on behalf of what you really teach and
         therefore learn. To this the verbal content of your teaching is quite
         irrelevant. It may coincide with it or it may not. It is the teaching
         underlying what you say that teaches you. Teaching but reinforces
         what you believe about yourself. Its fundamental purpose is to
         diminish self doubt. This does not mean that the self you are trying
         to protect is real. But it does mean that the self you think is real
         is what you teach.

         4 This is inevitable. There
         is no escape from it. How could it be otherwise? Everyone who follows
         the world's curriculum, and everyone here does follow it until he
         changes his mind, teaches solely to convince himself that he is what
         he is not. Herein is the purpose of the world. What else, then, would
         its curriculum be? Into this hopeless and closed learning situation
         which teaches nothing but despair and death, God sends His teachers.
         And as they teach His lessons of joy and hope, their learning finally
         becomes complete.

         5 Except for God's
         teachers, there would be no hope of salvation, for the world of sin
         would seem forever "real." The self-deceiving must deceive,
         for they must teach deception. And what else is hell? This is a
         manual for the teachers of God. They are not perfect or they would
         not be here. Yet it is their mission to become perfect here, and so
         they teach perfection over and over in many, many ways until they
         have learned it. And then they are seen no more, although their
         thoughts remain a source of strength and truth forever. Who are they?
         How are they chosen? What do they do? How can they work out their own
         salvation and the salvation of the world? This manual  attempts to
         answer these questions.
