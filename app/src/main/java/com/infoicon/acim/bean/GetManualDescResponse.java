         2. Who Are Their Pupils?
         1 Certain pupils have been
         assigned to each of God's teachers, and they will begin to look
         for him as soon as he has answered the Call. They were chosen for him
         because the form of the universal curriculum that he will teach is
         best for them in view of their level of understanding. His pupils
         have been waiting for him, for his coming is certain. Again, it is
         only a matter of time. Once he has chosen to fulfill his role, they
         are ready to fulfill theirs. Time waits on his choice but not whom he
         will serve. When he is ready to learn, the opportunities to teach
         will be provided for him.

         2 In order to understand the
         teaching-learning plan of salvation, it is necessary to grasp the
         concept of time which the course sets forth. Atonement corrects
         illusions, not the truth. Therefore it corrects what never was.
         Further, the plan for this correction was established and completed
         simultaneously, for the Will of God is entirely apart from time. So
         is all reality, being of Him. The instant the idea of separation
         entered the mind of God's Son, in that same instant was God's
         Answer given. In time this happened very long ago. In reality it
         never happened at all.

         3 The world of time is the
         world of illusion. What happened long ago seems to be happening now.
         Choices made long since appear to be open, yet to be made. What has
         been learned and understood and long ago passed by is looked upon as
         a new thought, a fresh idea, a different approach. Because your will
         is free, you can accept what has already happened at any time you
         choose, and only then will you realize that it was always there. As
         the course emphasizes, you are not free to choose the curriculum or
         even the form in which you will learn it. You are free, however, to
         decide when you want to learn it. And as you accept it, it is already
         learned.

         4 Time really, then, goes
         backward to an instant so ancient that it is beyond all memory and
         past even the possibility of remembering. Yet because it is an
         instant that is relived again and again and still again, it seems to
         be now. And thus it is that pupil and teacher seem to come together
         in the present, finding each other as if they had not met before. The
         pupil comes at the right time to the right place. This is inevitable
         because he made the right choice in that ancient instant which he now
         relives. So has the teacher, too, made an inevitable choice out of an
         ancient past. God's Will in everything but seems to take time in
         the working-out. What could delay the Power of eternity?

         5 When pupil and teacher come
         together, a teaching-learning situation begins. For the teacher is
         not really the one who does the teaching. God's Teacher speaks to
         any two who join together for learning purposes. The relationship is
         holy because of that purpose, and God has promised to send His Spirit
         into any holy relationship. In the teaching-learning situation, each
         one learns that giving and receiving are the same. The demarcations
         they have drawn between their roles, their minds, their bodies, their
         needs, their interests, and all the differences they thought
         separated them from one another fade and grow dim and disappear.
         Those who would learn the same course share one interest and one
         goal. And thus he who was the learner becomes a teacher of God
         Himself, for he has made the one decision that gave his teacher to
         him. He has seen in another person the same interests as his
         own.
